The effect of acid inputs on the environment depends on the quantity and acidity of atmospheric inputs  and the buffering capacity of the terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. The effect of acidic precipitation on soil is potentially significant because the soil is the reservoir of plant nutrients and the source of much of the water for aquatic systems.
